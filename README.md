# angular-spectrum-method
simple matlab function of angular spectrum method of fast calculation of diffraction with band limitation setting, zero padding setting and so on.

简单的角谱衍射计算matlab函数，可以设置是否加入带限、是否填0等。

example: quan=ASM(1,1,1,1,p,2,300,pitch,lambda); 

示例: quan=ASM(1,1,1,1,p,2,300,pitch,lambda); 

the band limitation method is from "Band-Limited Angular Spectrum Method for Numerical Simulation of Free-Space Propagation in Far and Near Fields"
